# BigDFT-nb
The BigDFT Notebook Experience

## Welcome to the BigDFT-nb project!

In this repository you will find different studies from BigDFT calculations, supported by notebooks and data.
The idea of this project is to enforce collaboations between people with the objectives of 

* Sharing data and logfiles
* Stabilise and track production results
* Track data and analysis for future reuse
* Provide a playground for research continuity

Each study should go in a subdirectory, and should be accompanied by one (or more) Jupyter notebooks, explaining the results and how to retrieve the data.
