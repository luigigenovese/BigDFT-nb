# Polarizability tensor calculation

A notebook polarizabilityi\_tensor.ipynb presents how to perform a 
polarizability tensor calculation using a python script. It presents how to
handle the BigDFT input files and initial geometries as objects.

# Raman spectrum calculation

Another notebook raman.ipynb presents how to get the Raman energies and 
intensities of a given system. 
Note that to get the Raman spectrum intensities with BigDFT, some 
polarizability tensor calculations must be performed.
