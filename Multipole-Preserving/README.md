# Notebooks related to the multipole preserving feature

This directory contains the notbooks related to the article *Multipole-preserving quadratures for the discretization of functions in real-space electronic structure calculations*, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2015,17, 31582, about the multipole preserving of the ionic charge.

![Cinchonidine energy versus the grid spacing](http://bigdft.org/Wiki/index.php?title=File:Percent-cinchonidine.png)

Two notebooks shows the total energy error in percentage in fucntion of the grid spacing for two systems:
* the simple H atom;
* the cinchonidine molecule C19H22N2O.
This error is totally correlated to the ionic charge which is not preserved by the traditional method *i.e.*, the collocation method.

The last notebook displays some results about the geometry *i.e* the bond length of the H2 molecule versus the grid spacing. There is also a fine analysis of the egg-box error associated to the rotation of the molecule.
