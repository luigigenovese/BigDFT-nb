# Quantum Mechanical Embedding from Pentacene Cluster

In this example we will provide some illustration on how the definition of electrostatic embedding potential
might contribute in the evaluation of fragment quantities like for example the induced dipole on the
fragment monopoles.

The files of interest are

 * QMQME-Fragments.ipynb is the notebook where the analysis is performed
 * The python script QMMMBuild.py has been used to create the averaged environment that has been used in the
   example
 * The QMMM-Fragments.py script is the python conversion of the identical notebook which is present in the tutorial directory
